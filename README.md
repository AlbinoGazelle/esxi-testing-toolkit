## About

ESXi Testing Toolkit is a command-line utility designed to help security teams test detections deployed in ESXi environments. It takes heavy inspiration from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) but provides ESXi-specific enhancements and a simpler user experience.
