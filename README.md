# Overview

ESXi Testing Toolkit is a command-line utility designed to help Detection Engineering teams test detections deployed in ESXi environments. 

The toolkit is split into **vm** and **host** modules. The **vm** module is focused on actions that impact a single virtual machine, for example deleting all snapshots using the ESXi API. The **host** module contains actions that impact the entire ESXi host, such as disabling the autostart process of all VMs.

[!CAUTION]
ESXi-Testing-Toolkit modifies your ESXi environment. Please take precautions and only execute it against test environments.
