## About

ESXi Testing Toolkit is a command-line utility designed to help security teams test detections deployed in ESXi environments. It takes heavy inspiration from [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) but provides ESXi-specific enhancements and a simpler user experience.

<talk about methods of execution and modules here>


### Tests

After [installing](#installation) the toolkit run the following command to view all available tests, their dependencies, and [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) mappings.

```
esxi-testing-toolkit list all
```


# Installation
Clone the repository and follow one of the supported installation methods.
```
git clone https://github.com/AlbinoGazelle/esxi-testing-toolkit.git
```
## pipx (Recommended)

Install pipx with the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Use pipx to install esxi-testing-toolkit.
```
cd esxi-testing-toolkit
pipx install .
esxi-testing-toolkit --install-completion
```
Restart shell for command completion.

## pip
```
cd esxi-testing-toolkit
pip install .
esxi-testing-toolkit --install-completion
```
Restart shell for command completion.

## Setup
In order to connect to an ESXi system, the toolkit requires credentials for a valid administrator account. This can be provided in two ways. 

### .env File
The toolkit first checks for valid credentials in the form of a `.env` file located in the root directory of the project `esxi-testing-toolkit/.env`. Create the file using:
```
cd esxi-testing-toolkit
touch .env
```

Populate the newly created file with three variables `ESXI_USERNAME`, `ESXI_PASSWORD`, and `ESXI_HOST`.

```
# file: .env
ESXI_USERNAME="USERNAME"
ESXI_PASSWORD="PASSWORD"
ESXI_HOST = "ESXI_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS"
```

### Environmental Variables
If the toolkit cannot find a `.env` file, it will check the systems environmental variables next. The variable names are `$ESXI_USERNAME`, `$ESXI_PASSWORD`, and `$ESXI_HOST`.

You can set these variables with the following commands:

#### Linux
```
export ESXI_USERNAME="ESXI_USERNAME"
export ESXI_PASSWORD="ESXI_PASSWORD"
export ESXI_HOST="ESXI_HOST"
```
#### Windows
```
set ESXI_USERNAME="ESXI_USERNAME"
set ESXI_PASSWORD="ESXI_PASSWORD"
set ESXI_HOST="ESXI_HOST"
```
