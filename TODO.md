- create `retrieve_logs` that retrieves the last X lines from hostd or shell.log and prints to console.
    - Add divider print statement to make it obvious when we're printing logs from ESXi host.
    - Evaluate if we should be printing the logs or retrieving the files themselves and placing them in a directory.
- add skeleton functions for enumerate all VM ids. 
    - add warning to suggest that users run this command first to see valid VM ids
